# Bluebonnet
_**Chosen for the 'Design Award' among student submissions for an Intro to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) class.**_

Utilized the [Design Thinking Process](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) to ideate several user-centric solutions, and generate over 20 low fidelity prototypes to solve a specific urban gardener's problem. The entire process can be found on this [Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/nDiWd8E8V55gojPmxhGzXE/Design-Process---Bluebonnet?type=design&mode=design&t=mP9BBTK9IBAdRSOi-1).
